# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies various supervised learning algorithms on the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset to predict the likelihood of a person being diabetic based on medical indicators such as BMI, age, insulin levels, and more.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis and visualizations using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Applied preprocessing steps including label encoding, null handling, and feature selection (e.g., SelectKBest, RFE).
- Built and evaluated classification models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Decision Trees
  - Naive Bayes

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - PIMA Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yukta31/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
